+ Project summary:
+ Example: When the user types in the chat box: I'm not feeling well and can't go to work or do normal activities. I have a slight fever. I have been coughing with a sore throat and a runny nose. I'm not hungry and I can't eat any food. I seem to have lost my sense of taste and eat without taste. Next, the user needs to click Send to send the message. Our remote virtual doctor will then automatically respond to a comprehensive analysis based on the symptoms described by the user: Five diseases with symptoms similar to those you describe and how similar they are: flue, hay fever, catarrh,  sore throat and Coronavirus (COVID-19). The disease most similar to the one you described and its probability:  Coronavirus (COVID-19) 48.89%. Summary of treatment recommendations: drink fluids like water to keep yourself hydrated and get plenty of rest. Wear loose,  comfortable clothing – don't try to make yourself too cold. Take over-the-counter medications like paracetamol – always follow the manufacturer's instructions. If the user clicks the FRESH button, all chat history will be cleared.
